Created in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 53

A short 2D platformer experience where the player must navigate through different cube shaped worlds by viewing them from different angles in order to collect shards and traverse through portals leading to other worlds.

# HOW TO PLAY

- Hold Left Mouse Button and drag mouse to rotate the world cube.

- Press A / D to move.

- Press Space to jump (can perform a small boost after half a second)

- Hold ESCAPE for 3 seconds to close the game.

- Scroll Wheel Adjusts distance from the cube

Different sections of the level are projected on to each side of the cube. Rotate the cube as you are moving between different parts of the level to see where you are going. Collect all yellow shards and deliver them through the final portal. The section that is displayed on each side of the cube is randomized and so it is highly unlikely that you will get a straightforward layout. You must spend some time inspecting each side of the cube and figuring out what parts of the level are displayed on each side.
